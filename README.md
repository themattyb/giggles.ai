# Welcome to giggles.ai - Readme
## Goal
The hope is for this to become a community project that will help create a fun and interactive place where ai can be a fun place to learn and in the process make us laugh. 
## What this is not
This is not an AI generative tool for jokes or a replacement for comedians and writters
## What this might be...
I hope this can be a place where failed, but funny or quirky models might be released and open sourced for learning purposes.  A place to marvel in our ability to create weird, wacky, and downright funny results with AI tools.  
Obviously, some sort of OSS license will need to be adopted, and other things yet to come.
